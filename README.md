The Odin Project Foundations Course
Project: Etch-a-Sketch

Using DOM manipulation, create a browser version of something between
a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch

DONE:
- Set up GitHub repo
- Create index.html, main.css, main.js

TO DO:
- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript
-- Create a container div in html to hold the squares
-- Use Flexbox to make the square divs in a grid (vs. one on each line)

- Set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change colour when your mouse
passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through the grid
*Idea: use DOM methods and event listeners. When x happens, change the style (background-color) to a different color

- Add a button at the top of the screen that will send the user a popup (prompt) asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be
removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (creating a new sketchpad). 
-- Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100
-- The total number of pixels used won't be changed *I don't understand this part
